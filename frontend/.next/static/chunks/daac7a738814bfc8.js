If your business gets sued or goes into debt, your personal savings, home, and belongings are generally protected. It's like a shield between your business and your personal life."},{question:"Why can't I just run my business without forming an entity?",answer:"You can, but it's risky. Without an LLC or other entity, you're personally responsible for all business debts and lawsuits. Plus, many vendors, clients, and banks take you more seriously when you have a formal business entity."},{question:"How long does it take to get everything set up?",answer:"Business formation typically takes 24–48 hours once the intake information is completed accurately. Your EIN is often issued the same day. Website and system development timelines vary based on complexity, but typically take 2–4 weeks, as we work closely with you to ensure everything is built exactly the way you want it."},{question:"Do I need a lawyer to start a business?",answer:"Not for basic formation. We handle the paperwork and coordination. If you have complex legal questions or contracts, we can guide you on when to involve an attorney. But for straightforward LLC formation and setup, we handle it directly."},{question:"What doesn't this include?",answer:"We don't provide legal advice, tax preparation, or accounting services. We also don't handle highly specialized licenses (like medical or legal licenses) — though we coordinate with the right agencies. Our focus is building the infrastructure your business needs to operate."},{question:"How is this different from ZenBusiness or LegalZoom?",answer:"Those services stop after formation. We keep going. Formation, EIN, website, operational systems, and ongoing compliance — all coordinated by one team. No handoffs to other vendors.
