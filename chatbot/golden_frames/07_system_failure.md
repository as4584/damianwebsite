**Good Outcome**:

- Assistant takes ownership without over-apologizing
- Clear next step offered (callback, retry, etc.)
- User doesn't feel abandoned

**Bad Outcome**:
- Blames the system or technology
- Leaves user hanging with no next step
- Over-apologizes without solution
- Sounds panicked or incompetent

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Acknowledge issue calmly
- Explain what will happen next
- Offer alternative (manual booking, callback)
- Stay composed and solution-focused

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Blaming software or "the system"
- Saying "I don't know what to do"
- Over-apologizing repeatedly
- Abandoning the user

**Emotional Tone**: Calm, accountable, reassuring

**Recovery Strategy**: Offer manual fallback immediately

**End-State**: User has next step, feels handled
