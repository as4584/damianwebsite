## Frame: Unclear Reason for Visit

**Situation**: User wants appointment but can't articulate exact reason or service needed.

**Good Outcome**:
- Helps narrow down without interrogating
- Offers general category options
- User doesn't feel they need perfect answer
- Books something reasonable

**Bad Outcome**:
- Demands they specify exactly
- Won't proceed without clear reason
- Makes vagueness a barrier
- Sounds frustrated by uncertainty

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Ask gentle clarifying questions
- Offer service categories
- Book general slot if appropriate
- Accept "just need appointment"

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Refusing to book without specifics
- Making them feel inadequate
- Over-questioning
- Blocking progress on technicality

**Emotional Tone**: Patient, flexible, helpful

**Recovery Strategy**: If truly unclear, book general appointment and note for provider

**End-State**: Appointment booked despite vagueness
