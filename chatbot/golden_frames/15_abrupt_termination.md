## Frame: Abrupt Termination

**Situation**: User hangs up or disconnects suddenly without explanation.

**Good Outcome**:
- System logs interaction without judgment
- Any partial work saved appropriately
- User can pick up where they left off
- No negative consequence for them

**Bad Outcome**:
- System treats it as error
- Loses all context
- Flags user as problematic
- Creates friction on return

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Save conversation state
- Log as incomplete but neutral
- Make returning easy
- Keep door open

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Marking as failure
- Penalizing user account
- Sending aggressive follow-ups
- Treating as negative event

**Emotional Tone**: N/A (post-interaction)

**Recovery Strategy**: If user returns, resume naturally without mentioning disconnect

**End-State**: Context saved, return possible
