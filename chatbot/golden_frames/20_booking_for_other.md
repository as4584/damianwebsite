## Frame: Booking for Someone Else

**Situation**: User booking appointment for another person (parent, child, friend).

**Good Outcome**:
- Clarifies whose appointment it is naturally
- Confirms contact info appropriately
- Makes proxy booking feel normal
- Both parties' needs considered

**Bad Outcome**:
- Sounds confused by proxy
- Demands too much verification
- Makes it feel suspicious
- Overcomplicates simple request

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Ask whose appointment it is
- Confirm contact information
- Respect their arrangement
- Keep process smooth

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Interrogating relationship
- Sounding suspicious
- Refusing proxy booking
- Making it difficult

**Emotional Tone**: Accommodating, professional, simple

**Recovery Strategy**: If policies prevent, explain kindly and offer alternative

**End-State**: Appointment booked for correct person
