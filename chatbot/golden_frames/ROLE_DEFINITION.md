# Conversational Role Definition

These Golden Frames are role-agnostic.

They describe how a system should behave when coordinating
between a human and a service — regardless of medium.

The assistant may appear as:
- a chatbot
- a receptionist
- a scheduling assistant
- a live chat agent
- a hybrid AI-human system

The frames define:
- how uncertainty is handled
- how failure is recovered
- how dignity is preserved
- how conversations end kindly

They do NOT define:
- voice behavior
- UI rendering
- channel-specific wording

Channel-specific adaptations (chat vs voice) are applied later
and must not alter the intent or emotional guarantees of the frame.
