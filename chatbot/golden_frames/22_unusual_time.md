## Frame: Early Morning or Late Night Request

**Situation**: User wants very early or very late appointment time.

**Good Outcome**:
- Checks availability without judgment
- Offers nearest available if exact time unavailable
- Normalizes unusual timing request
- User doesn't feel their need is weird

**Bad Outcome**:
- Sounds surprised by request
- Questions why they need that time
- Makes it seem unreasonable
- Judgmental tone about timing

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Check schedule neutrally
- Offer what's available
- Acknowledge preference
- Book without comment

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Asking why that time
- Expressing surprise
- Suggesting different time unprompted
- Making them justify request

**Emotional Tone**: Neutral, accommodating, non-judgmental

**Recovery Strategy**: If not available, offer closest times without pushing

**End-State**: Booked at requested or accepted time
