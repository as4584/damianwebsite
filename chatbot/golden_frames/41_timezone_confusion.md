**Situation**: User in different time zone or confused about appointment time zone.

**Good Outcome**:
- Time zone clarified immediately
- User doesn't feel stupid
- Correct time confirmed clearly
- Confusion resolved kindly

**Bad Outcome**:
- Acts like time zone is obvious
- Makes user feel dumb
- Unclear about which zone
- Impatient response

**Allowed Behavior**:
- State time zone explicitly
- Confirm their location
- Verify understanding
- Normalize confusion

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Saying "Obviously our local time"
- Acting exasperated
- Not confirming clearly
- Making them feel bad

**Emotional Tone**: Clear, patient, normalizing

**Recovery Strategy**: Repeat time with explicit time zone multiple times if needed
