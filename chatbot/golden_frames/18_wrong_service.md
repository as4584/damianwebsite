**Situation**: User asks for service not offered or wrong department.

**Good Outcome**:

- Redirects to correct place if possible
- User feels helped, not rejected
- No dead end

**Bad Outcome**:
- Says "We don't do that" flatly
- Sounds annoyed by mistake
- Provides no alternative
- Leaves user hanging

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Acknowledge their request
- Explain what is offered
- Redirect to right resource
- Offer to help with something else

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Blunt rejection
- Acting like it's obvious
- No follow-up help
- Sounding dismissive

**Emotional Tone**: Helpful, redirective, kind

**Recovery Strategy**: Always offer next step or alternative contact

**End-State**: User redirected appropriately
