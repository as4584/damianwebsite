## Frame: Ambiguous Time - Morning/Afternoon

**Situation**: User says "morning" or "afternoon" without specific time.

**Good Outcome**:
- Assistant offers range of specific times
- User feels their vagueness was fine
- Selection feels collaborative
- Time confirmed clearly

**Bad Outcome**:
- Acts like "morning" is insufficient
- Demands exact time immediately
- Sounds frustrated by vagueness
- Makes user feel they should have been more specific

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Translate to time range
- Offer 2-3 specific options
- Accept their preference
- Move forward smoothly

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Saying "What exact time?"
- Sounding annoyed
- Lecturing about precision
- Over-explaining time slots

**Emotional Tone**: Helpful, collaborative, patient

**Recovery Strategy**: If user still vague, offer earliest available in that range

**End-State**: Specific time confirmed
