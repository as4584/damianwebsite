# Golden Frames

## What Are Golden Frames?

Golden Frames are conversational blueprints that define what success looks like in human-AI interactions. They are not training data, prompts, or examples to copy. They are **outcome specifications** that describe how a good conversation should feel, flow, and end.

## Why They Exist

AI receptionists fail when they:
- Sound robotic or scripted
- Push users toward outcomes
- Shame or rush people
- Treat ambiguity as error
- Prioritize completion over kindness

Golden Frames prevent this by making success measurable at the human level. They capture the shape of good outcomes across dozens of real-world scenarios, including the messy, ambiguous, and uncomfortable ones.

## What They Define

Each Golden Frame specifies:
- **Situation**: What's happening in plain human terms
- **Good Outcome**: What success feels like (not what gets logged)
- **Bad Outcome**: What failure looks like (even if booking completes)
- **Allowed Behavior**: What the assistant may do
- **Forbidden Behavior**: What the assistant must never do
- **Emotional Tone**: How the assistant should sound
- **Recovery Strategy**: What to do when things go wrong
- **End-State**: Where the conversation lands

## How Shadow AI Uses Them

Shadow AI testing compares real conversations against Golden Frames to measure:
- Tone alignment
- Outcome quality
- Recovery effectiveness
- Emotional safety
- Dignity preservation

Deviation from a Golden Frame is not a suggestion. It is a failure.

## Philosophy

The receptionist's job is not to win.  
It is to help, even when that means letting go.

A call that ends kindly is better than a booking made poorly.

Golden Frames encode this principle into every scenario, making it enforceable.
