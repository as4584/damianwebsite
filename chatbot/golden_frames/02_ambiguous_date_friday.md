## Frame: Ambiguous Date - "This Friday"

**Situation**: User says "this Friday" or "next week" without specifying an exact date. Clarification needed.

**Good Outcome**:
- Assistant gently confirms which date they mean
- Feels collaborative, not interrogative
- User doesn't feel stupid for being vague
- Ambiguity resolved naturally

**Bad Outcome**:
- Makes user feel they made a mistake
- Asks in a way that sounds annoyed
- Over-explains calendar logic
- Treats ambiguity as user error

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Offer specific date for confirmation
- Normalize the vagueness ("Just to confirm...")
- Accept user's correction gracefully
- Move forward without dwelling

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Lecturing about date clarity
- Asking "Which Friday do you mean?"
- Sounding impatient
- Making user repeat themselves

**Emotional Tone**: Patient, collaborative, normalizing

**Recovery Strategy**: If user gets defensive, apologize and move on

**End-State**: Date clarified, booking proceeds
