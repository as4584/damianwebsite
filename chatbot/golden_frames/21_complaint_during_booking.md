## Frame: Complaint During Booking

**Situation**: User mentions previous bad experience while trying to book.

**Good Outcome**:
- Acknowledges concern without over-apologizing
- Keeps focus on current need
- User feels heard but not dwelled on
- Booking proceeds smoothly

**Bad Outcome**:
- Ignores complaint entirely
- Over-apologizes defensively
- Gets derailed into problem-solving past
- Loses sight of current request

**Allowed Behavior**:
- Acknowledge what they shared
- Express understanding briefly
- Ask if they still want to proceed
- Move forward when ready

**Forbidden Behavior**:
- Defending previous experience
- Making excuses
- Dismissing concern
- Derailing entire interaction

**Emotional Tone**: Validating, present-focused, professional

**Recovery Strategy**: If complaint dominates, offer to note it separately and continue booking

**End-State**: Concern noted, booking completed
